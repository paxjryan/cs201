This repo is a pretty good overview of my familiarity with Racket; of particular interest might be languages.rkt, which focuses on strings, languages, DFAs, and CFGs.
For example, running the function (generate-string-from-cfg my-cfg), which has been slowly built up through the course of the homework, will print a randomly generated sentence from my-cfg, which is the recursive grammar that I wrote in problem 9. 
This pset, as well as an informal linguistics background (constructing languages has become somewhat of a hobby for me!), are the reason I'm excited to continue exploring linguistics and NLP especially.
